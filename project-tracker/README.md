#Simple Project Tracker 0.1

Reads project data from a json file of daily projects and uses Handlebars to display a simple calendar checking off days toward 100 days of small front end projects.

This project will evolve throughout the 100 days of projects to include an add project form, show project details page, better style, and trackers for other goals as well. I might even add some data visualization with Google Charts.

8 days down, 92 to go.

##Simple Project Tracker 0.2

Added function that fills in the remaining days from the last completed project to 100 days. Also added a divider every 28 days to separate each month.

9 days down, 91 to go.
