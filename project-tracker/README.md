#Simple Project Tracker 0.2.2

Gets new project inputs from the form and writes them to an object in preparation for posting them to the json file. Added a "Project added" confirmation modal that replaces the new project form modal. At this point I have a decision to make:

Continue on the JS only path and use localstorage to store the data or write it as a Rails app and save the projects to a database.

#Simple Project Tracker 0.2.1

Added new project form inside modal. It doesn't do anything yet, but I have a good understanding of how to create a modal without Bootstrap. I've also moved the project to a MAMP server so the ajax call works in Chrome.

As the code grows, I can see how modular development can be very handy for organizing the parts. I haven't guite grokked Backbone yet, but I'll give a go toward splitting up and organizing the js, html and css in the next iteration.

Down the line:
Create an asset pipeline or use an AMD asset pipeline. 
Use SASS and Backbone to speed and organize coding.

#Simple Project Tracker 0.2

Added function that fills in the remaining days from the last completed project to 100 days. Also added a divider every 28 days to separate each month.

#Simple Project Tracker 0.1

Reads project data from a json file of daily projects and uses Handlebars to display a simple calendar checking off days toward 100 days of small front end projects.

This project will evolve throughout the 100 days of projects to include an add project form, show project details page, better style, and trackers for other goals as well. I might even add some data visualization with Google Charts.
