#Hover Fade

Simple hover fade effect that I'm using on my portfolio as a storytelling technique. I admit, this is kind of just to quickly squeeze something out today.

The projects from the last two days are also in this file if you're wondering why I didn't mention the much cooler thumbnail hover effect lower down on the page.

I think I'll put the hover effects away for a while and do something different tomorrow.

7 days down 93 to go.
