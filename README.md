#100 Front End Practice Projects

After spending the last 6 months studying web development at General Assembly (Front End Web Development and Back End Web Development), I wanted to keep expanding my skills. As a pre-new year's resolution, I've started 100 days of teeny tiny bite-sized projects to keep learning and using new skills a la GiveIt100.com.

This repo is filled with those small projects.
