#100 Front End Practice Projects

After spending the last 6 months studying web development at General Assembly ([Front End Web Development](https://generalassemb.ly/education/front-end-web-development/san-francisco) and [Back End Web Development](https://generalassemb.ly/education/back-end-web-development/san-francisco)), I wanted to keep expanding my skills. As a pre-new year's resolution, I've started 100 days of teeny tiny bite-sized projects to keep learning and using new skills a la [GiveIt100.com](https://giveit100.com/).

This repo is filled with those small projects.

13 days down, 87 to go.
