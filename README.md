#100 Front End Practice Projects

After spending 6 months studying web development at General Assembly ([Front End Web Development](https://generalassemb.ly/education/front-end-web-development/san-francisco) and [Back End Web Development](https://generalassemb.ly/education/back-end-web-development/san-francisco)), I wanted to keep expanding my skills. This is a repository of teeny, tiny front end projects - maybe not 100, but some.

I've also come to really like codepen, too, so there are more projects there at [http://codepen.io/marklc44/](http://codepen.io/marklc44/).
