#CSS Marching Diagonal Lines Background

Saw this on [codekod.com](http://www.codekod.com/) and wanted to see if I could recreate it.

This is a CSS only hover animation of a gradient background. Hovering over the element creates continuous marching diagonal lines to highlight the block.

Thanks to [Continuous css transitions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12224047/continuous-css-transitions) and [Diagonal Lines Pattern](http://cssdeck.com/labs/diagonal-lines-pattern) for getting me started.
