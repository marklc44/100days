#Text Shimmer

##Shimmer using CSS 
Hovering over the text starts a shimmer effect with a `linear-gradient`, `translateX` and CSS hover. Hovering off the text shimmers back the other direction.

##Interval Shimmer using Javascript
Using a little JQuery to handle the click events and `setInterval` and `setTimeout` you can start and stop the shimmer back and forth with the anchors.
