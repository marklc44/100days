#Masked Thumbnails

I liked the masking and hover effects on [http://www.julienrenvoye.com](http://www.julienrenvoye.com) and wanted to recreate it for practice. I'm a sucker for any shape that's not a square or a circle.

This miniproject presents a list of thumbnails as a grid, each masked by png shapes which expand when you hover over them. Nothing earth shattering. If you notice on the original site, all of the items other than the one hovered over get grayed out. That will be tomorrow's project.
 
That site has a bunch of other animation goodies on page transitions and such, so I may be stealing a few more projects from that font of inspiration.
